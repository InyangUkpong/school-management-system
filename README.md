## Challenge Statement

The challenges we initially faced with our the Portfolio Project was during the deployment process, we tried using pythonanywhere but got a 404 error which we couldn't resolve due to the time constraint, we later tried using vercel since it allows us deploy directly from CLI, but due to issues it currently has with GitHub, we did some further research and discovered we needed to change our current database db.sqlite3 to PostgreSQL, so we opted using a tool PgAdmin for Postgres but later discovered we could conveniently configure our Django app with Postgresql on vercel. After making the neccessary recommended  configurations, there we still experienced difficulties due to compatibility issues and was shown an error of improper configurations as seen below.

## Success Statement

Eventually we decided to try using the Railway.app and also experienced some challenges during the first few tries of deployment, where we faced compatibility isssues with the version of the psycopg2 dependency in the requirements.txt, after rectifying this, we finally experienced a successful deployment.
